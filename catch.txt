Title
[JM] Catch22

Elavator Pitch
[JM] A game where you make split second decisions between two poor choices, which are represented by a simple graphic.
The player/character runs into the option they choose and a story is created in the backgrounmd as they do.
If they fail to pick an option in time, then the game ends and a printout of the story that they created is displayed.

30 second  gameplay description
[JM]By placing your finger on the touchscreen and dragging, your character follows the movement of your finger.
The game starts out slow and gradually gets faster giving time for players to play casually and generate a story that is
a couple of paragraphsin length. A summary of the choices will first be displayed, so that you don't have to read as much
text to get the gist of the story you have created. Beginning the game again a new random set of catastrophic occurances presents
itself, allowing you to start an entirely new story on your next run through.
