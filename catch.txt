Title
[JM] Catch22

Elavator Pitch
[JM] A game where you make split second decisions between two poor choices, which are represented by a simple graphic.
The player/character runs into the option they choose and a story is created in the backgrounmd as they do.
If they fail to pick an option in time, then the game ends and a printout of the story that they created is displayed.

30 second  gameplay description
[JM] You drag your finger across the screen and in so doing move your character which then collides with your different choices to create a story.
The game starts off slow and quickens over time, allowing new/casual players to easily create a short story that is 5 events in length.
Once missing an event choice, the game ends and the story prints out. There will be a paragraph for each event, but also a summary
of events chosen to allow players to enjoy the story they made without forcing them to read a lot of text if they do not wish to.
Then, beginning the game again a new random set of catastrophic occurances presents itself, allowing you to start an entirely new story on your next run through.

[JM] Humour, Touchscreen Drag, Colourful & Clear Graphics to Represent Events
